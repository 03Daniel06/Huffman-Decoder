# Huffman-Decoder
In this program I coded an algorithm to use Huffman decoding to find the true shape of a binary tree. 

The program takes in a file that contains the preorder and in-order traversal of a binary tree. The last line is the code used to find reconstruct the new binary tree using the original tree encoded in the the traversals.

To run the program you input a file in the following format: 
'9 0 6 3 2 8 4
6 0 2 3 8 9 4
0001011011100011'

The output would be the tree that is hidden encoded in the two traversal of the original binary tree. The second line is the orignal tree printed in postorder.
